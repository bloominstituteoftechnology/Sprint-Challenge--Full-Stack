1. What is the difference between Node.js and Express.js?

Node.js is a platform for building server-side event-driven i/o application using javascript.
Express.js is a framework based on node.js for building web-application using principles and approaches of node.js

2. What are the core features of Express.js

It provides convenient, basic web-server creation/routing tools, which so essential to bare-bones node.js.
It uses very flexible, modular middleware pattern, where special middleware modules/functions used to process different requests.
It is very frendly to functional programming and usage of Node.js core concepts - Event-emitters, Async flow and Streams.
It requires almost nothing to create and run the easy testable web server.

3. What is Postman and what is it used for?

A powerful GUI platform to make your API development faster & easier, from building API requests through testing, documentation and sharing.

4. What arguments are passed to Custom Middleware functions and what is the third parameter used for?

HTTP request, HTTP response, and a callback argument. You can provide multiple callback functions that behave just like middleware, except that these callbacks can invoke next('route') to bypass the remaining route callback(s). You can use this mechanism to impose pre-conditions on a route, then pass control to subsequent routes if there is no reason to proceed with the current route.

5. What is MongoDB and what is it used for?

MongoDB is an open source database that uses a document-oriented data model and a non-structured query language. It is one of the most powerful NoSQL systems and databases around today. Since it is a NoSQL database it does not use the usual rows and columns that we so much associate with the relational database management. It is an architecture that is built on collections and documents. The basic unit of data in this database consists of a set of key-value pairs.

The MongoDB NoSQL database can be extensively used for Big Data and Hadoop applications for working with humungous amounts of NoSQL data that is the major portion of the Big Data. MongoDB can also be successfully deployed for social media and mobile applications for parsing all the streaming information which is in the unstructured format. Content management and delivery also sees extensive use for the MongoDB NoSQL database. Another domain is the user data management and working exclusively in the data hubs.

6. What is Mongoose.js and what is it used for?

Mongoose is an object data modeling library that provides a rigorous modeling environment for data, enforcing structure as needed while still maintaining the flexibility that makes MongoDB powerful.
